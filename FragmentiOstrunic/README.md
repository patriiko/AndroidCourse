This repository contains solutions to the Android lab assignments.

## Lab Summaries

### Lab 1 - KalkulatorOstrunic

In this lab, the task was to create a custom calculator Android application using Android Studio, focusing on designing a visually appealing user interface with at least five well-organized view elements and supporting three languages.
The app required the use of resource files for all text values, a dynamic UI control for appearance customization, a custom app icon, and View Binding for resource management.

### Lab 2 - ListaOstrunic

In this lab, the objective was to develop a list-detail Android application featuring at least three custom activities, including a list of items using RecyclerView and a detail view that displays item information and an image.
The app required support for three languages, use of styles, resource-based static data, a custom icon, Parcelable data transfer, at least one broadcast receiver, an external activity call, a share menu with dialog and broadcast, and at least one custom animation.

### Lab 3 - FragmentiOstrunic

In this lab, the objective was to convert the existing list-detail Android application to use fragments instead of activities, implementing a master-detail layout for landscape orientation where the list displays on the left and details on the right, while maintaining single-pane behavior in portrait mode. The app required Firebase Cloud Messaging integration for push notifications, Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and retrieval, proper fragment communication through interfaces, and smooth orientation handling without losing existing functionality from previous labs.
